Ptolemy Layer for Google Earth (ptolemy)
========================================

Claudius Ptolemy, a famous ancient Hellenic geographer and astronomer
from Alexandria, Egypt, provided coordinates of 8000+ objects of the
known world (oikoumen?) in his classical Geography [1] and
supplemented them with many useful descriptions and names of tribes
that lived nearby.  In essence, Ptolemy provided the earliest
surviving world “map” described in terms of longitudes, latitudes, and
projections. However, this map containing valuable data on ancient
cities, villages, marts, harbors, rivers, etc. is difficult to
visualize, primarily due to major distortions apparent when the
Ptolemaic coordinates are compared to modern ones of the numerous
objects identified with certainty. Thankfully, those objects can serve
us as reference points in our effort to map out the places which (to
the best of our understanding) Ptolemy is talking about, using modern
coordinates.

This is part of a research project at Purdue. It is also hosted as a
[project at Purdue University Research Repository (PURR)]
(https://purr.purdue.edu/projects/ptolemy/view 
"Ptolemy Layer for Google Earth"). We are also building [a website
for the project](http://www.claudiusptolemy.org/), but it's pretty bare 
at the moment. We hope to remedy this in the near future.

Please note that the project is really just getting started, so what you
see here right now is very unstable and should be considered as under
construction. We are making it available early to collaborate within the
project team but also to make our work in progress visible to anyone else
who may share an interest.

Also, note that most of the scripts reference data files that are not 
yet releasable. This will be remedied as soon as possible where possible.
We are primarily using McCrindle's Ancient India as Described by Ptolemy
and Stuckelberger and Grasshoff. The latter in particular comes with a 
database we are relying on heavily to prime our initial model. We are also
looking at Stevenson to a degree, but realize it comes with problems. If 
you need help on this in the meantime please [contact me]
