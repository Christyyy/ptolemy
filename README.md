Ptolemy Layer for Google Earth (ptolemy)
========================================

Claudius Ptolemy, a famous ancient Hellenic geographer and astronomer
from Alexandria, Egypt, provided coordinates of 8000+ objects of the
known world (oikoumen?) in his classical Geography [1] and
supplemented them with many useful descriptions and names of tribes
that lived nearby.  In essence, Ptolemy provided the earliest
surviving world “map” described in terms of longitudes, latitudes, and
projections. However, this map containing valuable data on ancient
cities, villages, marts, harbors, rivers, etc. is difficult to
visualize, primarily due to major distortions apparent when the
Ptolemaic coordinates are compared to modern ones of the numerous
objects identified with certainty. Thankfully, those objects can serve
us as reference points in our effort to map out the places which (to
the best of our understanding) Ptolemy is talking about, using modern
coordinates.
